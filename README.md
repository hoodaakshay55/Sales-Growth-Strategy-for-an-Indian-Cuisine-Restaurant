# Sales-Growth-Strategy-for-an-Indian-Cuisine-Restaurant

Company Overview
An Indian restaurant offering a mix of dine-in and delivery services was
experiencing stagnant growth despite having a decent customer base and a broad
menu. The owner wanted to leverage historical order and sales data to uncover
business insights, optimize operations, and boost overall revenue.
A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Dashboard Reporting
initiative was launched to analyze patterns, improve decision-making, and predict
future sales trends.

🎯 Objective
The primary goal of this project was to:
Increase overall sales and profitability
Understand customer behavior and order
preferences
Identify top-performing and underperforming
menu items
Analyze time-based trends to optimize
operations
Develop a dashboard that presents actionable
insights for business growth

🗃 Dataset Overview
The dataset used in the analysis was a Raw CSV file titled “Indian Restaurant
Data.csv”. It contained records of customer orders with key fields such as:
Order Date and Time
Item Name and Category
Quantity and Price
Order Type (Dine-in/Delivery)
Revenue Metrics
Additional columns such as Month, Day of Week, and Hour were engineered
for time-based analysis.

Exploratory Data

Key Insights:
📈 Peak Hours & Days: Highest sales occurred during
weekend evenings.
🥘 Top-Selling Items: Biryani, Butter Chicken, and
Naan were the top contributors to revenue.
📉 Underperforming Items: Some niche items had
consistently low sales and high preparation cost.
🚚 Order Type Analysis: Delivery orders
outperformed dine-in in frequency but had lower
average order value.
🧭 Category Performance: Main courses generated
the highest revenue, while desserts had high margins
but lower sales volume.


📌Dashboard Development
KPIs: Total Revenue, Total Orders
Used line/area charts to display trends in revenue and order volume over time.
Enabled monthly and daily granularity for in-depth time-series analysis.
Displayed Top 10 selling items using a bar/column chart, sorted by total revenue or quantity sold.
Helped identify best-performing products.
Visualized sales distribution by category using a donut or pie chart.
Showed the percentage share of each category in the overall revenue.
Compared Dine-in vs Delivery sales using a stacked bar chart.
